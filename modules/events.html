            </h2>
            Software events often act as a medium to connect the ideas of students into a practical solution. It allows the students to turn their ideas into realization. Revolving around the centerpiece of software development and programming, software-based events and competitions offer interested participants to showcase their skills and explore their true potential.
            ‘Software Exhibition’ is a software event that provides the participants with a platform to present their past projects. The main objective of this event is to get the projects of the students out in the open in front of a live audience and get the feedback about the project from the audiences. The projects can be any minor/major projects, an individual project of the participant or projects made during any other software competitions or hackathons.
            This event will be conducted throughout the main event. The event is an Open-theme
            event i.e. the participants are allowed to present projects relating to any field or domain. However, the projects must be submitted prior to the event for undergoing selection.

              Event II – GameFest
            </h2>
            Gaming has always been a way for people to escape reality. Games are an important factor in making people familiar with improving technologies in the field of Computer science. The performative aspect to games has now moved to the stadium arena, where young, semi-professional cyber-athletes compete in video games on stages loaned from real world sport. To celebrate the contribution of Gaming in the field of Computer science, we are organizing a Gaming Fest.

              Event III – Hackathon
            </h2>
            A Hackathon is an event where programmers meet to do collaborative computer programming. Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch — these generally take shape in the form of websites and

            mobile apps. To sum it up, at a Hackathon, people come together and use technology to transform ideas into reality.
