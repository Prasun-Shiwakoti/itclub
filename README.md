## 🛠 Code Standards & Contribution Guidelines

To maintain code quality, collaboration efficiency, and project consistency, please follow the guidelines below:

### ✅ General Conventions

* **Code Formatting:**
  All code must be formatted using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules. Ensure your editor is configured to auto-format on save where possible.

* **Styling:**
  Place all common/global CSS rules inside `src/app.css`.

* **Variable Naming:**
  Use `camelCase` or `PascalCase` for naming variables. If you find inconsistencies, feel free to correct them and submit a pull request (PR).

* **Push Practices:**
  Avoid creating multiple PRs for small changes. Group related changes together to keep the workflow efficient and maintainable.

### 📦 Commit Message Format

Use the following format for all commit messages:

```
<type>: <short description>
```

Where `type` must be one of:

* `feat`: ✨ A new feature
* `fix`: 🐛 A bug fix
* `docs`: 📚 Documentation-only changes
* `style`: 🎨 Code style changes (whitespace, formatting, etc.) with no logic impact
* `refactor`: 🔨 Code restructuring that does not change behavior or fix bugs
* `perf`: ⚡ Performance improvement
* `chore`: 🔧 Maintenance or tooling changes (build scripts, CI, etc.)

By following these conventions, we ensure cleaner code, better collaboration, and faster project evolution. Thank you for contributing to the IT Club KEC projects!
